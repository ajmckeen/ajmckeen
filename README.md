- <b>First Robotics Competition 2020 Team [1768](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/1768)</b>
  - Contibution: Major  design of ~~half the robot and ~~half fabrication and assembly
    - Most of the time mentors on FRC teams carry the process but 1768 is mostly actually students.
  - Skills / Technologies: Solidworks for CAD & mechanical design, Fusion 360 for CAM, CNC milling
  - Accomplishment: Built a pretty robot that barely saw the light of day because of COVID üôÉ
