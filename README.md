- <b>First Robotics Competition 2020 Team [1768](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/1768)</b>
  - Contibution: Major  design of ~~half the robot and ~~half fabrication and assembly
    - Most of the time mentors on FRC teams carry the process but 1768 is mostly actually students.
  - Skills / Technologies: Solidworks for CAD & mechanical design, Fusion 360 for CAM, CNC milling
  - Accomplishment: Built a pretty robot that barely saw the light of day because of COVID üôÉ

- <b>Unified Robotics - Mechanical and Sensing applicaition</b>
  - Group projects with cute [Romi](https://www.pololu.com/product/4022) robots, controlled by ESP32 in C++
  - Cool stuff: Fourbar design, motor control, sensors & navigation, IMUs, IR cameras, MQTT communication
  - Robot superstructure & actuators CAD in SolidWorks and 3D printed.
  - Robots accomplished pick & place and coordinated movements

- <b>Intelligent Robotics Arm</b>

[![Robot Arm Demo Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LgPf89N6zGk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgPf89N6zGk)

  - Pick and place 3 DOF robotic arm intelligently controlled using MATLAB and video camera / conputer vision techniques
  - Color/shape based object recognition and localization
  - Calculated DH parameters, forward and inverse kinematics, trajectory planning

- <b>Mobile Robot Localization and Mapping</b>
  - LiDAR equipped [Turtlebot](https://www.turtlebot.com/turtlebot3/) localized, mapped, and explored an unknown environment
  - Programmed using ROS, primarily in Python
  - Project demo included two phases
    - Phase 1 used SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) to explore maze-like board. Mapping and localization data sent through ROS to RVIS and Gazebo. This creates a grid map for C-Space ([configuraiton space](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./motionplanning/lecture/Chap3-Config-Space_howie.pdf)) calculation and A* path planning
    - Phase 2 uses the map created from phase 1 and navigates the map using AMCL (adaptive Monte Carlo localization)
