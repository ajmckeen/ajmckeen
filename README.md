- <b>First Robotics Competition 2020 Team [1768](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/1768)</b>
  - Contibution: Major  design of ~~half the robot and ~~half fabrication and assembly
    - Most of the time mentors on FRC teams carry the process but 1768 is mostly actually students.
  - Skills / Technologies: Solidworks for CAD & mechanical design, Fusion 360 for CAM, CNC milling
  - Accomplishment: Built a pretty robot that barely saw the light of day because of COVID üôÉ

- <b>Intelligent Robotics Arm</b>
  - Pick and place 3 DOF robotic arm intelligently controlled using MATLAB and video camera / conputer vision techniques
  - Color/shape based object recognition and localization
  - Calculated DH parameters, forward and inverse kinematics, trajectory planning
  - Click on the thumbnail below to watch the demo video!

- <b>Mobile Robot Localization and Mapping</b>
  - LiDAR equipped [Turtlebot](https://www.turtlebot.com/turtlebot3/) localized, mapped, and explored an unknown environment
  - Programmed using ROS, primarily in Python
  - Project demo included two phases
    - Phase 1 used SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) to explore maze-like board. Mapping and localization data sent through ROS to RVIS and Gazebo. This creates a grid map for C-Space ([configuraiton space](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./motionplanning/lecture/Chap3-Config-Space_howie.pdf)) calculation and A* path planning
    - Phase 2 uses the map created from phase 1 and navigates the map using AMCL (adaptive Monte Carlo localization)

- <b>Global Stem Initiative in Robotics (OpenSTEM)</b>
  - This was an IQP (Interactive Qualifying Project) directed by Brad Miller and Joesph Doiron. Our role was to create resources, support infrastructure, and communication platforms for WPI's OpenSTEM platform under the Global School, mainly focused on supporitng robotics teachers around the world
  - Initiative generated these WPI marketing articles, apparently our project was highly marketable:

- <b>LEMUR: Learning and Education for Machine Learning for Undergraduate Robotics</b>
  - Developed curriculum and lab materials for an undergraduate level course at WPI to teach applications in artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and reinforcement learning
  - Conducted field research and gathered feedback from faculty and students about course materials
  - Designed new course materials, lab activities, and lecture content to address gaps in university curriculum

<h2>Graduate Level Robotics Projects:</h2>

- <b>Deep Learning</b>
  - TIPID: Tool for Inpainting Image Detection
  - Trained a CNN (convoluitonal neural network) using transfer learning from Densenet121
  - Tranining using ADAM and binary cross-entropy loss, and achieved accuracy for detecting AI image editing of 92%
  - We are very confident that this image that we generated with AI was in fact generated with AI
  ![AI generated](https://github.com/ajmckeen/ajmckeen/assets/93172250/4852c623-854f-4db8-a370-c773ac5292a9)

- <b>Papers</b>
  - Swarm Intelligence: [Effect of Random Walk Parameter Tuning on Local-Sensing Swarm Agents in Environmental Exploration and Target Locating.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15539179/Effect.of.Random.Walk.Parameter.Tuning.on.Local-Sensing.Swarm.Agents.in.Environmental.Exploration.and.Target.Locating.pdf)
    - Conducted a study on random walk algorithms used by robot swarms. The core of the study was focused on how far robots should drive and how much they should turn.
  - Deep Reinforcement Learning & Robot Controls
